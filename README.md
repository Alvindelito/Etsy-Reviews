# Etsy-Reviews

<!-- Right now, I have my data stored in one table containing all the relevant information needed for each user creating and displaying a review. Some of the data that I am storing are: userName, userPhoto, the user’s review, user rating, user review’s date, the purchased item description, the purchased item picture, and the name of the owner that sold the item.

I am using mySQL to hold all my data. I chose this because this is the most comfortable database for myself and I knew that I was only going to use 1-2 tables. 

I plan to store all the data in one table and access the different parts of the table to display the different properties of each review.  -->
